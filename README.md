# WaterMe
An iOS app that tracks water intake

Purpose:
This app allows its user(s) to keep track of how much water they are drinking.
This done through receiving daily input (or however frequently they use the app) and storing the data.
The user is able to see how much they've been drinking throughout the week/month/year in a graph.

This is the basic functionality, further features may be added later on.
